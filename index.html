      <p>Do you ever wonder how the place we came from affects the way you feel, think or even remember things? Our origins, whether social or environmental or cultural, act like a wind, swaying how we think. From the first memory we had, to the chemistry lesson you had yesterday are all part of us. But, in a world filled with mimicking and diverse experiences, it is essential to understand our past, lineage and culture, because it can be a powerful ally.</p>

      <p>One of the strongest ways our origins influence our way of learning is through culture. Culture acts like a glasses or lens that we see the world around us. In other cultures, learning is something that is experienced together, where students work together and share ideas. In others, it's strictly independent and solitary. These cultures shape us not only how comfortable we feel with others but how we absorb information. Some students from one culture prefer learning from discussion and yapping. Some other students from a different culture prefer independent work and practice. What I'm trying to say is that analyzing your culture and other factors can help you not only study and remember information quicker but more effectively.</p>

      <h2 id="culture"></h2>
      <p>Language also plays a huge role in how we learn. The first language we learn to speak, builds the foundation of how we understand media today. Many bilingual people often have different perspectives as they understand more than one language. Additionally, some languages are more oral than others. This can affect how one can remember things. For example, many indigenous languages are based on storytelling. This causes people to learn that language to easily remember information. On the other hand, languages like Italien are written more, so people from that language will remember reading things more. </p>

      <p>My first language was arabic. Arabic is a very old language, more than 1445 years old. People who believe in Islam, read and study The Quran, which is read in Arabic. In fact, the Quran was first written in a type of Arabic called Quranic Arabic or Classical Arabic. Even though it is not a spoken language today, it is read by millions of people every day.</p>

      <p>The environment of where we grew up also affects our learning. Someone born in a big city with access to technology and education will learn differently than someone born in a rural village in Pakistan or Iran. We can imagine our mind like the environment we live in. Each environment is unique, with a deferment amount of sunlight, wind, rain and snow. All of this helps your brain to learn in different ways.</p>

      <h1 id="art"></h1>
      <p>In the end, understanding our roots can help us understand how we live, think and understand text and media. Every language, culture and environment we are exposed to effets the strengths and struggles in how we learn. When we take time to reflect on our origin story, we can use it as a tool to help us understand things more accurately and clearly.</p>
